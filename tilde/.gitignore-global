# Enforce this .gitignore on all projects by
# adding the following to your `~/.gitconfig`:

# [core]
#     excludesfile = ~/.gitignore-global

# Personal ad-hoc folders. This means I can keep an `@clarity`
# directory anywhere in a repo without version-controlling
# it or polluting that project's .gitignore.
**/@clarity/

# Past this point, this is just a template, for reference.
# This is because .gitignores should be version-controlled
# on a per-project basis. If these were globally ignored,
# a user could easily forget forget a line in a project's
# own .gitignore. For this reason, it's all commented out,
# meant to be cherry-picked from.
